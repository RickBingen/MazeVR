# MazeVR
Unity VR game. Short Maze.


All assets are from the SNAPS office pack, and I personally didn't have any issues with building out the level
or with most of the XR components.

I do have an issue where the raycast from the left controller is constantly blinking due to raycast being valid not valid.
Maybe its detecting the teleport reticle.

I also had great difficulty being able to test my app. I could not get it to work via Oculus link. I eventually built it directly on the headset, 
but I had issues there as well.
